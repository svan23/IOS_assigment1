            description: "People born in the Year of the Monkey are the erratic geniuses of the cycle. They are remarkably inventive, clever, skillful, flexible, and original, easily solving the most difficult problems. There are few fields in which they wouldn't be successful, but they have a habit of being too agreeable. They want to do things now, and if they cannot get started immediately, they become discouraged and sometimes leave their projects. Although good at making decisions, they tend to look down on others. Having common sense, they have a deep desire for knowledge and have excellent memories. They are strong-willed, but their anger cools quickly. They are most compatible with the Dragon and Rat.",

They like to be busy and are devoted beyond their capabilities, deeply disappointed if they fail. People born in the Year of the Rooster are often quite eccentric and often have rather difficult relationships with others. They always think they are right and usually are! They frequently are loners, and though they give the outward impression of being adventurous, they are timid. Rooster people's emotions are like their fortunes, swinging from very high to very low. They can be selfish and too outspoken but are always interesting. They can also be extremely brave and are most compatible with people born in the Year of the Ox, Snake, and Dragon.",
